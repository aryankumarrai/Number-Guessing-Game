# Number Guessing Game 🎲

A simple **Number Guessing Game** developed in C++ where the player guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Enjoy a classic game that challenges your ability to find the correct number based on hints provided after each guess! 😎

## Overview ✨

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player is prompted to guess the number. After each guess, the program indicates whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. Once the correct guess is made, the player is given the option to play again. 🔄

## Features 🚀

- **Random Number Generation:** Uses the C++ standard library (`cstdlib` and `ctime`) to generate random numbers. 🎲
- **User Feedback:** Provides instant feedback if the guessed number is too high or too low. 📉📈
- **Replay Option:** After guessing correctly, you can choose to restart the game or exit. 🔁
- **Simple and Lightweight:** A minimal and engaging C++ console application for practicing basic programming constructs and game logic. 💻
